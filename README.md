# DIME Beauty Interview Assignment
Here is my completed assignment! Thank you for taking the time to review my code, I enjoyed completing this assignment.
## How to run
To run the application, first you need to fork the repository and clone it to your local machine. Then, navigate into the root of the directory and run "npm install" (Requires Node to be installed) from the command line to install all required dependencies. Then run "npm start" and it will open the application in the browser.

## A few notes
- I debated putting the shop URL and access token in a .env file, but opted to leave them in the repo as they were listed in a public repo in the instructions and it's much easier to get the application up and running this way
- It appears that to apply a discount to a cart, there needs to be a discount set up on the admin side of the Shopify store. So I just added a discount with a code I made up, but it doesn't actually apply a discount to the cart. It does represent the discount on the UI, though.
- I opted not to include the "Add Product" header that was in the attached screenshot, as the screenshot looked to be a native app, and it would look differently on web anyway. As a result, the rest of the page is further up to fill the space
